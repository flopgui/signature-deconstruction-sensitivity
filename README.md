# Sensitivity analysis of mutational signature deconstruction methods

Collection of R functions that can be used to generate synthetic mutational spectra from a cohort of real-life mutation samples and to do some computations on them.

Developed during an internship stay at the [Institute for Research of Biomedicine](https://www.irbbarcelona.org) of Barcelona, as a part of the [Maths4Life 2021](https://www.irbbarcelona.org/en/talent/young-scientists/maths4life-2021) program.
